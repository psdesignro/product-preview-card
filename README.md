## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS style pre-processor


### What I learned

I used SASS for the first time, even if I consider this project is too small to check all its benefits. I will consider using it in my following projects to practice it more.

At some point I got stuck, because none of my styling updates were being applied to the HTML, even if everithing was setup correctly. After hours of researching and test I found the issue, and I would be thankfull if someone can confirm this: it seems like (by mistake) I edited manualy the compiled .css file instead of the .scss, and from that point, all my new styling were not applied. 

I learnt it the hard way, but I will be more carefull in the future



### Continued development

 I will consider using SASS in my following projects to practice it more.
